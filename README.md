# Matomo Advanced tag for Google Tag Manager Server Side

Matomo Advanced Tag automatically parses event data in the server Google Tag Manager container and tries to map it to standard events or e-commerce tracking.

Event set-up methods:
- Inherit from client. The tag will automatically parse event data and map available data.
- Custom. With the help of this method, you can track pageviews and other custom events by adding event category, event action, and event name.

Types of actions that server-side Matomo tag supports:
- pageview
- event tracking
- e-commerce tracking

## How to use the Matomo Advanced tag:


**Tracking URL** - Tracking HTTP API endpoint, for example, https://your-matomo-domain.example/matomo.php

**Use Optimistic Scenario** - The tag will call gtmOnSuccess() without waiting for a response from the API.
